Your task would be:

1. To create a simple page that loads a list of albums by making an AJAX call to an API. Refer to the prototype video to check the design and functionality.

API - https://rallycoding.herokuapp.com/api/music_albums
Protoype Video - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z2iY3W3VIh9yFNpMU8vNA6E1nYG2XnUW/view?usp=sharing

2. Each album has three functions 
	a. Buy - On clicking, the Confirm button appears and Buy and Hide buttons get hidden.
	b. Hide - Hides the album on click.
	c. Confirm - On clicking confirm, redirect to amazon purchase page. You can find the redirection url in API response. Study it thoroughly.

3. Use your own HTML, CSS, and Javascript. No plugins can be used.

4. Task is simple. Your code would be evaluated on:
	a. Readability
	b. Simplicity
	c. Modularity

5. Hints and basic code flow: 
	a. Make an AJAX request
	b. When response arrives, prepare the html and render it on screen.
	c. Attach the required events on possible actions (click of buttons like Buy and Remove)

Good Luck!
